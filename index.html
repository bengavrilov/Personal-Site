            <h1>Reverse Image Search</h1>
            <hr>
            <h5>&emsp; &emsp; Nowadays most search engines provide some support for image retrieval, which allows you, for example, to search the web for images that are similar to a given image. 
                If a search engine used a single process to search a large number of images to find the most similar one it would take a very long time to get the results. This project
                allows users to input an image file and a directory (think of this as the global dataset) to search for the most similar image. The user can then choose to either perform
                the search using a single process or to use a parallel version that forks new processes and manages communication through various pipes. In reality, determining how similar
                two images are is a complex problem, which is in fact an active area of research. The project uses a simple metric based on the Euclidean distance between two pixels of 
                different images. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate drastic performance differences between delegating a task to a single process vs a parallel process.

            <h1>Image Database (for querying)</h1>
            <hr>
            <h5>&emsp; &emsp; It is important to ease data access so that logs and reports can be completed more effectively. This project consists of an image database that allows for storage
                and querying of different image files. When entering an image a user must select some attributes associated with the image. These attributes are then used to query. When querying
                a user must select an array of attributes and the query will return all images with all the given attributes. The user can also perform removal queries where images with the given
                attributes are deleted. The project also allows for a print command which prints all of the current images in the database. Keep in mind that when querying, images are returned in
                order of insertion, that is the most recently added images in that query will appear last. (<a href="https://github.com/bengavrilov/Image-Database" target="_blank">Github Link</a>)

            <hr>
            <h5>
                &emsp; &emsp; Image manipulation seems to be a rather popular feature among many image based platforms (I.e, Instagram, Snapchat). Image manipulation can be achieved rather easily by
                manipulating the rgb colour spectrum. Images are usually represented by dimensions of pixels, and so we can manipulate each individual pixel. Each pixel for a colour image is encoded 
                by three numbers representing the colour of the pixel. The first number is the red value, the second number is the green value, and the third number is the blue value for that individual
                pixel. Given this structure we can perform manipulations. For example, suppose we want to make a coloured image black and white. This can be done by averaging the values of all three
                colour numbers for a pixel and replacing each of those colour numbers with the average. Do this for all pixels and voila! (<a href="https://github.com/bengavrilov/Manipulate-Images" target="_blank">Github Link</a>)

            <h1>Text Compressor</h1>
            <hr>
            <h5>
                &emsp; &emsp; Compression allows for more practical data storage and transport. It is what allows us to access content at a time effective rate. Think about streaming sites, it would take far
                too long to transmit the actual file size. Instead it is compressed and decompressed upon transmission to save time but more importantly space! This program allows a user to upload a .txt file 
                and compress it to a form thats on average ~30% smaller in size whilst maintaining its original integrity. Upon usage run the decoder to get the original .txt file. The algorithm uses the huffman coding model to achieve loseless compression. A huffman 
                 code is a type of prefix code. The algorithm takes all the unique characters in the .txt file and derives a Huffman tree from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence of each character 
                  for all the common characters. Since we know that a .txt file contains characters and symbols where each character/symbol requires a byte (8 bits) of storage; we can encode this to manipulate file size.
                   Instead we store each character in its encoded binary representation. The idea is that characters/symbols that appear more frequently in the file will be represented by a binary representation 
                   smaller than 8 bits in size. Characters that don't appear frequently in the file can take up a greater amount of bits. The net size will always be smaller than the original file.

            <h1>Pathfinding Visualizer</h1>
            <hr>
            <h5>
                &emsp; &emsp; Pathfinding algorithms have always been one of the most critical structures for many modern applications. Take a look at google maps for example, when you want to get directions
                to a location, google maps gives you a route. Now note that this route is the shortest possible path at the current time as it would be too time costly to give an arbitrary path. Factors that determine
                the shortest path may include traffic and the number of lanes on a road. These are all congestion factors that help find the shortest path. Take a look at another scenario within Uber Pool for example.
                You are putting a second stop before your final location so the shortest path must consider the shortest path to the second stop and then the shortest path to the final stop. These are all features that have
                been implemented into this visualizer. You can add checkpoints as well as add obstructions between points and the application will still find the shortest path. Some of the algorithms used include
                Dijkstra's algorithm, A* Search, Breadth-first Search, and Depth-first Search  (this will not always yield the fastest path). Play around with the application to gain a better understanding of Pathfinding
                algorithms.

                &emsp; &emsp; What's the worlds most sought after resource? An uninterrupted medium for communication. Our means of communication is often the most overlooked technological tool. Today we
                are able to communicate via messaging, emailing, video chatting, audio chatting, as well as in plenty of other forms. It is crazy to think that two people at separate locations on earth can communicate over
                the internet. Although not as complex as many modern day communication platforms, this chat application hosts a server (a main lobby per say) where individuals can log on with their first and last name 
                and chat with anyone else on the server anywhere around the world. This is in principle how a reddit forum works or perhaps a discord chat operates. The app was made with Node.js, express, and websockets
                to allow different clients to communicate via the server. The client interface always displays the number of current users on the server as well as notifies them when a user has entered or left the main chat.
